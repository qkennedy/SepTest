	Okay, so, I got the code related to the last portion of the project working (mostly).  I think this was an important step in P5 considering it relies on P4 working.  Still having some quirky issues that I think could be resolved by implementing hash to quickly check for repeated states, and improving my heuristics to properly take into account distance traveled in a move.  Overall, I think this went decent.  Kind of confused documentation wise, were we supposed to keep track of everything past initial state on our own? that was eventually how I got it to work but I feel like there has to be a better way to actively change the state.
