Jackâ€™s First Commit:

   For the first commit of Project 4, I essentially implemented most of GameState. I coded the initial constructor, isGoal(), generateChildren(), heuristic(), compareTo() and equals(). There are some rather elementary implementations that I wish to fix in the future, like the heuristic method. Additionally, I transferred the A* method from our second project into PlannerAgent, and outlined what needed to be changed in the method in order to work for this implementation. Beyond that, I began to work on PEAgent, but realized that I needed some more time to study the StripsAction interface to understand exactly how to implement the method. I will be fully implementing this method within the next two weeks.

Since the code is not currently in working form, we have yet to generate any working plans. Therefore, only the README is included for now. Like before, I have had no issues with the documentation. All is well!
